Australia-Post-Shipping-Calculator

Wordpress Australia post shipping calculator for all ecommerse plugins

Hello everybody,

I am trying to create the plugin for wordpress. It is basically Australia post plugin.

Recently, I have came across strange problem as I was working in a website which was using
Wp-ecommerce online store plugin. Everything works fine but suddently after Australia post changed its API shipping part of the code stop working. As its a bit of uncomfortable specially for owner of the store who dont have any technical knowledge. 

My plan is to create plugin independent of any ecommerce plugin in wordpress and all existing ecommerce plugin in wordpress can just hooked-up with this plugin to calculate shipping cost for there calculation.

It would be much more easier to update this plugin as developer and store owner do not have go through sub-plugin errors in shipping modules.

I am starting with the sctrach and currently I do not have much knowledge in worpress plugin development.

Any contribution of you will be Appriciated.

Thanks for Reading. Be a part of it.


This is a Wordpress plugin in development, to test this please copy auspost folder into "wp-content/plugins" folder and start testing.
